**Seattle Interactive Conference** and the **AT&T Developer Program**, with support from **Cobalt, Greenqloud** and **Microsoft**, have partnered to create a unique Hackathon event on the weekend of **October 26-27** at **REACTOR, 2820 Elliott Ave at Broad St, Seattle, WA 98121** (new venue), immediately prior to SIC.**** 

This hackathon will be focused on wearables (yes, things you can wear, anywhere on your body) and gaming apps. We will have Cypress PSOC boards and ARM mBed boards (similar to Arduino). In addition to this, we will have additional breadboards and other complemetary hardware for your building delight. Of course, you are also welcome to bring your own parts.  

AT&T will also be introducing it's M2X platform, a cloud-based data storage service and management toolset built for the "Internet of Things". The M2X API gathers real-time data from connected machines and translates that data into meaningful information for quick decisions, automated actions, and strategic analysis. Learn more about M2X at m2x.att.com

**What We Supply:**  Quick presentations and code samples to help bootstrap your hacking, food to keep you going, and caffeine to keep you awake. Along with technical advisers to assist you in building faster, smarter, and with new tools. 

**What You Bring:** Your laptop, skills & ideas. Come with a collaborative, team-focused mindset and/or team up in advance on Twitter/Facebook/Google%2B via the #sichack hashtag. Whether you are a highly trained developer and code in Ruby/PHP/.NET or are a designer and only work with Illustrator, you are invited to attend this event. Every group needs a good balance of talent and your development skills are needed!
