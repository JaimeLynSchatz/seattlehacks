REACTOR and HouseOgames have partnered together to put on a monthly Game Jam appropriately titled "HOGjam" for the community.  The first one will be 32 hours.  We start at 10am on Saturday the 26th of October and run until 6pm on Sunday.  We encourage participants to suggest themes for HOGjam by heading on over the the HouseOgames forums [http://houseogames.com/forums/ ][1]and getting involved under our "Events" topic.   

[AT&T][2] will also be "In Da House" putting on one of their awesome Hackathons.  If you're in the competitive mood you can sign-up to be included in the AT&T | [SIC][3] Mobile App Hackathon which has it's own cool theme!  Head on over to [http://hacksic.eventbrite.com][4] if you'd like to participate in the AT&T | [SIC][3] Hackathon.   

**What We Supply:**  A gathering place for the community to come and collaborate together to make some awesome games, food to keep you going, and caffeine to keep you awake. 

**What You Bring:** Your laptop, skills & ideas. Whether you are a highly trained developer and code in Ruby/PHP/.NET or are a designer and only work with Illustrator and want to make a card game, you are invited to attend this event. Every group needs a good balance of talent and your skills are needed!
