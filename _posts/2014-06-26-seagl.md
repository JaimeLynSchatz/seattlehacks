SeaGL is a grassroots technical conference dedicated to spreading awareness and
knowledge about the GNU/Linux community and free/libre/open-source
software/hardware. Our goal for SeaGL is to produce an event which is as
enjoyable and informative for those who spend their days maintaining hundreds
of servers as it is for a student who has only just started exploring
technology options. SeaGL's first year was 2013.

The cost of attendance is free.

Attendee Registration will not require the use of non-free software.

More info can be found on our website, http://seagl.org

We look forward to seeing you there
