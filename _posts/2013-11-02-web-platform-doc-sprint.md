WebPlatform.org is an open community of developers building resources for a better web, regardless of brand, browser or platform. Anyone can contribute and each person who does makes it stronger. Together we can continue to drive innovation on the Web to serve the greater good.

This Doc Sprint is all about making it easy for anyone to contribute articles, samples, tutorials, overviews, and insights. Learn about webplatform.org, how to contribute, and help grow the definitive reference site for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG and more.

This is your chance to create/review articles that will become the reference for millions of web professionals around the world: come leave your mark (and name!) in web history!

WebPlatform.org is convened by W3C and is made possible by the support of the Web Platform Stewards.

Please bring your own computer. We will serve Halloween snacks, lunch & drinks, and yes, there will be some cool swag & a Surface Pro for you to win!
Enrolled students will also receive an official participation certificate signed by Microsoft and the W3C - something you can definetly attach to your resume!

A better web starts here - with you!
