**PARTICIPATE IN THE TIZEN HTML5 DEVLAB & HACK**  

Join the Tizen experts and learn how to build and/or port your first mobile Tizen app using HTML5 during this DevLab and Hack, December 6-7 at Cross Campus Santa Monika. The Tizen OS is the new mobile version of Linux, largely based on HTML5 and backed by Intel, Samsung and LG.  
  
The event kicks off on Friday with a short DevLab which will cover the SDK, web api's and libraries.  
  
We will make sure to have SDK's available and enough technical support throughout the event. And of course, beer and yummy food will be provided!  
  
$2k in cash prizes and developer devices for teams who hack an app!
