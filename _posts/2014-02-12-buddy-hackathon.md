Buddy is a backend as a service (BaaS) for developers of apps on any connected device. Whether you're building apps or games for iPhone, Android, Windows Phone, web apps, SmartTV apps, connected car apps, or apps on headless connected appliances - we have the backend infrastructure for you.

For many scenarios, you could build your app with no server-side code needed!

While we've had our V1 platform on the market for almost two years, it's time to roll out a new, improved version of the platform. Our "V2" platform - now with more "awesome" - is nearing public release, and to celebrate we're going to host a hackathon in our Seattle offices this weekend. There'll be prizes, there'll be food, there'll be beer, and there'll be devs on hand to help with any issues you find.

How will it work? Easy! Come to Buddy on one or both days, and build your app. Any kind of app, any platform - but you must use Buddy's APIs at least in some part. This is a competition - like all hackathons - but unlike most where you are judged on your app, this time you'll be judged on the number and quality of bugs you find.

That's right - find bugs in Buddy's API surface, and we'll reward you handsomely. The top bug finders over the course of the weekend will win prizes:

* 1st Prize: $300
* 2nd Prize: $150
* 3rd Prize: $50

All participants: an AWESOME Buddy swag kit
We'll also provide food (pizza, snacks, other goodies) and beverages plus a great work environment to focus on writing some killer code. Fancy working from home/Starbucks/your office/your dorm? No problem - remote participants are welcome as well!

Finally, all participants will be able to keep their Buddy accounts after we launch V2 and build their apps free of charge using the platform. And you'll always have our undying gratitude! :)

Feel free to forward this invitation - we'd love your help in getting the word out! In the meantime, check out http://buddy.com to learn more about us, and if you'd like to get a headstart on the preview docs for the V2 platform, then spend some time here.

See you this weekend!
