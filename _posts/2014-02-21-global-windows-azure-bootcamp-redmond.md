Event Info:

On Saturday, March 29, 2014 we are out to make some records!

In April of 2013 we held the first Global Windows Azure Bootcamp at more than 90 locations around the globe! This year we want to again offer up a one day deep dive class to help thousands of people get up to speed on developing Cloud Computing Applications for Windows Azure. In addition to this great learning opportunity the hands on labs will feature pooling a huge global compute farm to perform diabetes research!

WHAT IS WINDOWS AZURE BOOTCAMP?
A one day deep dive class organized by the community to help thousands of people get up to speed on developing Cloud Computing Applications for Windows Azure.

AWESOME. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
This event is FREE to the attendees, this includes lunch, drinks and snacks throughout the day. Gratis! Gratuite! Libero!

WHAT DO I NEED TO BRING?
You will need to bring your own laptop and have it preloaded with the specified software [listed here](http://bit.ly/1h3pchf). Please do the installation upfront as there will be no time to troubleshoot installations during the day.

IS THIS FOR BEGINNERS?
Yes and no. The local trainers will use the Windows Azure Training Kit to guide you through the basics. Weâ€™ll also be running a massive scalability experiment that may bring one of the Windows Azure datacenters down!
